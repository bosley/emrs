Working on API/ CLI

NOTE:

  its important to include `https://` in the EMRS request urls if https is being used.




api/submit is currently being worked on

  - go client api complete

  - asset validation complete
  - token validation complete
  - data extraction from http body complete

  > Need to create work force, scheduler, etc to continue here,
      as all we need to do now is actually submit the thing

  use:
      --submit e1310f68-03e3-e436-e3f8-527765b8b650:example.action.path@https://localhost:8080 --data "hello

      the asset id prefixed onto the path will need to match that of an asset stored
      in the emrs database

      UUID:server@host:port

      --data may be omitted




api/status

  - api client can send GET to server /status/
  - server responds with uptime

  > currently complete

  use --stat host:port




api/ cnc

  One method planned, but this will mostly be for GUI control (come later)
  but basic CRUD operations could be stubbed in and tested using cli
